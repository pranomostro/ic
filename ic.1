.TH IC 1
.SH NAME
ic \- input contains

.SH SYNOPSIS
ic REGEX

.SH DESCRIPTION
ic returns 0 (true) if it's input contains REGEX, and
returns 1 (false) if it encounters EOF and didn't find
STR in any line.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B ic test </dev/urandom
.TP
reads from /dev/urandom until it finds the string test
test.
.TP
.B ps -A | ic rlwrap
.TP
returns true if a rlwrap process is running and false otherwise.

.SH STATUS
0 when the string was found in the input, 1 if not, and 255 when the
usage was printed.

.SH BUGS
Using ic in pipes does not really work well, since results of pipes
can't be examined properly on unix (plan 9 does it really good, though).
Possible solution: let it print "yes" or "no" if the string was found or not.
.P
ic can be easily written in any language, so why choose myrddin?
But then again-why not?

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR grep(1) does the same thing, faster.
